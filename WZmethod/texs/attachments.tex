\section{Proofs of identities}
We want to remind the reader that in Wilf-Zeilberger's method we find a polynomial $F(n,k)$. Then we want to find another polynomial $G$ such that $(F,G)$ is a certifying pair of polynomials, meaning that
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $F(n+1,k)-F(n,k)=G(n,k+1)-G(n,k)$, and
  \item $\lim_{k\to\pm\infty} G(n,k)=0, \forall n$.
\end{enumerate}
We can also express this by finding a proof certificate $R(n,k)$ such that
\begin{equation*}
  G(n,k)=R(n,k)F(n,k-1).
\end{equation*}

In both proof 7 and 8 we have integer variables, $c$ and $r$ respectively. These cause problems in step 2 in Gosper's algorithm, since the polynomial $f$ would have a degree dependent on $c$ and $r$, respectively. This cannot be handled by the automatic solver.

The automatic prover cannot find a polynomial $f$ in step 2 of Gosper's algorithm. This is since the degree (with respect to $n$) of the left and right hand side of the equation
\begin{equation}
  p_k=q_{k+1}f_k-r_kf_{k-1}
\end{equation}
cannot be the same.

Also in this example the automatic solver cannot prove the identity, and the problem lies in step 2 of Gosper's algorithm.
