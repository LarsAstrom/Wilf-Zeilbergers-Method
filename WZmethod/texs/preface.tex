The thesis has been written in Lund during September-December 2019, as a master's thesis in the program Engineering in Mathematics. The idea of the thesis came from my supervisor, professor Victor Ufnarovski, who presented ten different, all very interesting problem formulations for a master thesis, only a few days after I asked if he had any ideas that we could do as a master's thesis.

Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor Victor Ufnarovski, who has not only been of great help during the thesis work, but also previously in my life as coach in the international mathematics olympiad. There I got help both to become better at mathematics, but also in other aspects with continuous positive feedback.

Secondly, I would like to thank my family and friends, who have supported me both while writing my thesis and previously in my studies and in my life.
